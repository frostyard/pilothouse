# AGENTS

This project is derived from `housecat-inc/scratch` and follows its core stack:

- Idiomatic Go
- HTML via templ
- HTMX for focused interactivity
- Vanilla CSS and JavaScript sparingly

Keep management features isolated in `internal/modules/<name>`. Web modules may collect unprivileged read-only data locally. Privileged reads must use a fixed broker query, and mutations must use a fixed broker action. Register privileged implementations only in `cmd/pilothoused`; never add arbitrary command execution, filesystem access, or generic socket proxying to the broker protocol.

Run `make generate` after editing `*.templ`. Never hand-edit generated `*_templ.go` files.

Run `make test` and `make build` before handing off changes.
