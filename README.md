# Pilothouse

Pilothouse is a local web administration console for [Snosi](https://github.com/frostyard/snosi) installations. It starts with an attractive live system dashboard and complete sysext lifecycle management through Snosi's `updex` interface.

The application is bootstrapped from [housecat-inc/scratch](https://github.com/housecat-inc/scratch): Go and templ on the server, HTMX for focused page updates, an embedded design system, and no Node runtime or external frontend assets.

## What works

- Live CPU, memory, persistent storage, load, uptime, network totals, host, OS, and kernel metrics
- Automatic dashboard refresh every 15 seconds
- Live attention view for disk, memory, load, failed systemd units, and unavailable status sources
- Systemd service, socket, and timer inventory with administrator-only lifecycle and enablement controls
- Layered discovery of shared `sysupdate.d` and component-scoped `sysupdate.<name>.d` Snosi definitions through updex
- Installed and merged state from `systemd-sysext`
- Install, remove, update-all, and merge-refresh actions through `updex` and `systemd-sysext`
- System Podman inventory for containers, pods, images, engine version, reported image storage, and bounded log viewing
- Administrator-only container start, stop, restart, and safe removal actions
- System Docker Engine inventory with container lifecycle controls, bounded log viewing, and socket isolation
- Local Incus project inventory for containers, virtual machines, and images with lifecycle controls
- Administrator-only browsing, download, and atomic upload within configured host file roots
- PAM authentication using Snow's users and account policy
- Opaque, idle-expiring broker sessions with per-session CSRF tokens
- An unprivileged web process and a root-only action broker connected through a protected Unix socket
- Group-based administration, POST-only mutations, origin checks, strict command arguments, and bounded command timeouts
- Durable privileged-action history, destructive confirmations, and per-resource action serialization
- Durable background jobs for extension update and refresh operations
- Extension update availability, reboot-required posture, and confirmed host reboot
- Exact systemd backup timer monitoring with freshness and last-result health
- Liveness and broker-aware readiness endpoints at `/healthz` and `/readyz`
- Responsive desktop and mobile layouts

## Develop

Go 1.26 or newer is required.

```bash
make test
make build
sudo ./bin/pilothoused --socket /tmp/pilothouse-broker.sock --socket-group "$(id -gn)"
./bin/pilothouse --broker-socket /tmp/pilothouse-broker.sock
```

Docker equivalents are available when the host does not have Go, PAM headers, or systemd headers installed:

```bash
make docker-generate
make docker-fmt
make docker-build
make docker-test
make docker-lint
```

Each target checks the reusable development image through Docker's build cache and uses persistent Docker volumes for Go and linter caches. Container commands run as the host user, so generated files and build output remain writable. `make docker-run` uses host networking and starts the web process, but broker-backed operations require separately mounting a broker socket into the container.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8888` and sign in with a non-root system account. Any authenticated account can view the dashboard. Members of the configured broker admin group (`sudo` by default) can perform sysext, Podman, and Docker mutations.

The default is intentionally loopback-only. Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and add `--secure-cookie` to the web service before exposing it to another machine.

When a reverse proxy changes the upstream `Host`, configure the browser-visible origin explicitly. The option is repeatable; an HTTPS origin automatically enables secure cookies.

```bash
./bin/pilothouse --allowed-origin https://admin.example.test
```

The packaged service also reads comma-separated origins from `/etc/pilothouse/pilothouse.env`:

```ini
PILOTHOUSE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://admin.example.test
```

Configure exact backup timers for the privileged broker in `/etc/pilothouse/pilothoused.env`. Pilothouse deliberately does not infer backups from unit names.

```ini
PILOTHOUSE_BACKUP_TIMERS=restic.timer,borg.timer
```

Configure Files only on the privileged broker. `--files-root` adds a read-only
root and `--files-write-root` adds a writable root; each flag is repeatable and
uses `id=absolute-path`. The unprivileged web process never receives root paths.

```bash
sudo ./bin/pilothoused \
  --files-root logs=/var/log \
  --files-write-root imports=/var/lib/pilothouse/imports
```

The filesystem root (`/`) is rejected. Symlinks are displayed but never
followed. Downloads and uploads are limited to 256 MiB each. Uploads are
available only in writable roots, are atomically published as `root:root` mode
`0640`, and reject existing destination names rather than overwriting them.

## Module architecture

The central contract is deliberately small. Every management module provides:

- a manifest for navigation and ordering;
- zero or more cards for the landing dashboard;
- its own routes, handlers, domain service, actions, and templ views.

The shell knows only about `platform.Module`; it does not import concrete modules. The web composition root registers presentation modules. The broker composition root separately registers privileged queries and action implementations. Modules submit fixed query and action identifiers through `platform.Host`; they never execute privileged commands or connect to root-equivalent service sockets in the web process.

The Podman module intentionally manages the root/system store used for host services through the Podman 5.0 or newer Libpod API. Enable the rootful API socket with `sudo systemctl enable --now podman.socket`; use `--podman-socket` to select a different Unix socket. The Docker module targets the system Docker daemon. The Incus module uses the official SDK against `/var/lib/incus/unix.socket` and allows selection from projects reported by that local daemon; it never reads configured Incus remotes. Rootless and remote workloads remain isolated from this system administration surface.

See [docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md) for a worked module template and [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for the trust model.

## Install on Snosi

```bash
make build
sudo systemd-sysusers packaging/pilothouse.sysusers
sudo install -Dm0755 bin/pilothouse /usr/local/bin/pilothouse
sudo install -Dm0755 bin/pilothoused /usr/local/libexec/pilothoused
sudo install -Dm0644 packaging/pilothouse.service /etc/systemd/system/pilothouse.service
sudo install -Dm0644 packaging/pilothoused.service /etc/systemd/system/pilothoused.service
sudo install -Dm0644 packaging/pilothouse.pam /etc/pam.d/pilothouse
sudo install -d -m0755 /etc/pilothouse
# Set PILOTHOUSE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in /etc/pilothouse/pilothouse.env when using a reverse proxy.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now pilothouse.service
```

For an immutable production image, package the binary and unit in a dedicated sysext and keep mutable updex state under `/etc/sysupdate.d` and `/var/lib/extensions.d`.
